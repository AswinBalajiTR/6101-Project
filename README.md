# 6101-Project
Our research focuses on analyzing the relationship between urban air quality and public health through an exploratory data analysis (EDA). The dataset captures key environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and visibility, alongside health-related metrics including severity scores and health risk scores. By exploring this data, we aim to identify patterns and correlations between air quality and health outcomes.

The following questions are the main subjects which this project focuses on:
   1)	Analyze how air quality indicators vary across different seasons and cities.
   2)	Investigate the key meteorological factors that significantly influence health risk scores.
   3)	Determine the ability to predict periods of heightened health risk based on air quality and weather conditions.
   4)	
These insights could help inform public health strategies, allowing for proactive interventions during periods of poor air quality. Furthermore, the findings may assist urban planners in developing strategies to mitigate air quality risks, contributing to healthier living environments in urban areas.

Data Source: The dataset in this project, titled Urban Air Quality and Health Impact Dataset, contains over 1,000 observations with 46 variables.
